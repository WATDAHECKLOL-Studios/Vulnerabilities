## Games like this steal players from actual well made games that deserve players, and not some free model chatgpt slop, owned by money hungry developers, who dont even care about their own fanbase but rather money!

## Learn all about the vulnerabilities that almost killed the pouplar game "SCP Roleplay classic!"

## This is how the story goes:

## I first found out about the game by a friend, I decide to take a look, At first the first vulnerability discovered was the play sound, I was very pleased with this, and I decide to take a deeper look.

## I decide to decomplie and anylze the game, and mostly all the scripts were made by ChatGPT! And soon realized the entire gun system was vulnerable, and soon more were discovered, going under watermole's radar for more under a week!

## While at first walermole decided to downplayed the severity of the situation, as soon as he noticed when we were in-game, he decided to teleport one of our employees and say "stop using my remotes"
## He didn't even care! He was still making money!

## As a result we decided to change that, and sadly at first the playsound vulnerability was the first to go, but none else, he skipped right over the most severe vulnerability of them all, the weld vulnerability!
## After noticing he skipped over every vulnerability, we were extermely pleased with his ignorance, as he contuines to downplay the situation to the public as things still get worse!

## Now all the sudden, the entire map is in the air, and all the spawns are deleted!
## Oh how lost he was, panicing internally, trying to accept help from the public, but trying to appear fine on the outside! Initally he first thought it was an adonis vulnerability, how silly of him!

## He decided to add an anti-cheat (funny enough is stolen from the adoni's anti cheat lmao).
## Even the anti cheat he added didn't like him, and decided to go rouge and false postive almost everyone!

## Now this anti-cheat as you expect, didn't stop us by one bit, but we decided to bypass it anyways, to simply get rid of any potential threat, even if it doesn't actually pose a threat.
## After awhile, he gave up, and hired someone to patch the game for him, now suddenly the clueless egoistical roblox developer who didn't know how to patch anything suddenly patched everything.

## Luckily for us, even when he had a 3rd party intervented, they still failed to patch, as the infinite money vulnerability and give any tool vulnerability went under the radar for months!
## Months later, we decide to take a visit, and unfortnatuly every single one of our vulnerabilities were patched.

## Thankfully the patches were done way too late, we already had our fun, I am sure you miss us!
